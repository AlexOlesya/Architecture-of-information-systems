        "Отметим, что рекомендации сработали только для первого пользователя, т.к. он хотел новости про спорт и все рекомендуемые новости относились к спортивным. Второй пользователь получил в рекомендации только спортивные новости, несмотря на его расширенный список предпочтений. Также отметим, что список отранжированных новостей двух пользователей отличился только тремя позициями. Из чего следует заключить, что рекомендации действительно меняются в зависимости от предпочтений пользователя, но система требует доработки (возможно, нужно пробовать другие методы кластеризации и подсчета расстояний)."
